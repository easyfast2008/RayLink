I have this project which is basically a Xray core vpn app for iOS, I need you to follow design_document.md guidelines and build the project. You can use subagents specialized for each task.
Things I need you to consider is that UI/UX is very important to me, I want this app to be fluid, Unique, Easy and simple to use and eye catching, there is some references to other examples which you can get inspired by, but I need you to come up with a Unique design pattern and keep this accross different sections of the map, every element should placed correctly and thoughtfully to maintain best User Experience.
Second thing is I need you to try to build the project as complete as possible following latest architecture designs and clean code guidelines. Then guide me through on how to build the required library and basically how to make this app up and running. If you need anymore info or permission that might help you to proceed better feel free to ask for it.
